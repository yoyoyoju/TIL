### 1 intro

#### types of knowledge
* declarative knowledge: statements of fact.
* imperative knowledge: recipe or how-to.
    * sequence of simple steps
    * flow of control (when each step is exeucuted)
    * when to stop


#### basic machine architecture
* memory
* control unit
    * program counter
* arithmetic logic unit
    * do primitive ops
* input and output


#### aspects of languages
* syntax
* static semantics: syntactically valid strings have meaning
* semantics: meaning (when syntatically correct and no static semantic error)

#### python programs
* program: a sequence of definitions and commands.
    * difinitions evaluated
    * commands executed (to do something)

* objects
    * scalar (cannot be subdivided)
        * int, float, bool, NoneType
    * non-scalar (have internal structure that can be accessed)
        * str, list, tuple

* expressions: combine objects and operators
    * has a value, which has a type
    * `<object> <operator> <object>`
    * `i/j` : division, float
    * `i//j`: int divisionquotient without remainder, int
    * `i%j`: remainder when i is divided by j
    * `i**j`: i to the power of j


#### binding variables and valus
* equal sign `=`: assignment, binds name to value
* re-bind variable names using new assignment statements
    * previous value may still stored in memory but lost the handle for it.




### 2 str branching iter

#### strings
* *immutable* : cannot be modified. (should re-bind to new object to change)
* operations on strings
    * `'ab'+'cd'`: concatenation
    * `3 * 'a'`: successive concatenation
    * `len('abc')`: length
    * `'abc'[1]`: indexing (begins with index 0)
    * `'abcd'[1:2]`: slicing([includec:excluded], [:] to copy it)


#### input output
* `print("hello", a)` or `print("hello " + str(a))`
* `num = int(input("get input and return as int"))`

#### while loop
```python
while <condition>:
    <expression>
    <expression>
```
* if `<condition>` is `True`, do all the steps inside the while code block
* check `<condition>` again
* repeat until `<condition>` is `False`
* if you use counter, it must be initialize before loop and increment it inside loop


#### for loop
```python
for <variable> in range(<some_num>):
    <expression>
    <expression>
```
* `range(start=0, stop, step=1)`: loop until `stop - 1` 


#### break
* immediately exits whatever loop it is in
* skips remaning expressions in code block
* exits only innermost loop




### 3 loops str guessandcheck approximation bisection

#### float
* how to decimal to binary
    * `(x%2)` - the last binary bit
    * `(x//2)` = all the bits get shifted right
* how about fractions [code for this](fraction_binary.py)
    * multiply by a power of 2 big enough to convert into a whole number.
    * then convert to by ninary
    * divide by the same power of 2 (shift right)
    * if there is no integer `p` for `x*(2**p)` to be a whole number then it is an approximation




### 4 functions recursion

#### functions
* name, parameters(0 or more), docstring, body

```python
def func_name(parameter)"
    '''
    docstring to write specification
    '''
    # body
    return parameter % 2 == 0

func_name(2)
```


#### variable scope
new scope for the function is created (when the func is called)
* inside a function, can access a variable defined outside. But cannot modify it.
    * first look for the variable inside of its own scope
    * if not access from outside (but cannot modify)


#### functions as arguments
example code from lecture
```python
def func_a():
    print('inside func_a')  # does not return anything

def func_b(y):
    print('inside func_b')
    return y

def func_c(z):  # takes one parameter, another function
    print('inside func_c')
    return z()

print(func_a())
print(5 + func_b(2))
print(func_c(func_a))
```


#### keyword arguments and default values
```python
def func_with_default(a, b = True):
    if b:
        return 2 * a
    else:
        return a

func_with_default(a, False)
```

#### modules
`import module` or `from module import *`(only when the names don't collide)


#### files
```python
nameHandle = open('file.txt', 'w')
name = input('enter name: ')
nameHandle.write(name + '\n')
nameHandle.close()

nameHandle = open('file.txt', 'r')
for line in nameHandle:
    print(line)
nameHandle.close()
```
* `w` to write
* `r` to read




### 5 Tuples Lists Mutability Cloning

#### Tuples
* an ordered sequence of elements, can mix element types
* immutable: `t[1] = 4` gives error for tuple `t`
    * to change it re-bound to new tuple: `t = (2, "one") + (4,)`
* example: `()`, `("one",)`, `(1, "one", 3)`
* careful with singleton tuple `(1,)` not `(1)`
* convenient usage:
    * swap variable values `(x, y) = (y, x)`
    * return more than one value `return (q, r)`


#### Lists
* ordered sequence of information
* mutable: elements can be changed `L[1] = 5` for list is ok
* can mix element types but usually homogeneous
* operations on lists:
    * `L.append(element)`: mutates the list
    * `L.extend(some_list)`: mutates the list
    * concatenation, `+`: combine lists together
    * `del(L[index])` delete element at a specific index
    * `L.pop(index)`: remove and return element in the index
    * `L.remove(element)`
        * look for the element and remove it
        * multiple element: removes first occurrence
        * element not in the list: error
    * `L.sort()`(mutate `L`)  and `sorted(L)` (return result)
    * `L.reverse()` : reverse indexwise
* List to Str
    * `list(s)`
    * `s.split(' ')` : split the string with given parameter
* Str to List
    * `''.join(L)`


#### Mutation Aliasing Cloning
* List: *mutable*
    * an object in memory
    * variable name points to object
    * side effects
    * avoid mutating a list as iterating over it

Examples:
```python
aList = [1, 2, 3, 4]
bList = aList       # they are pointing the same objectg
cList = aList[:]    # copy every element (pointing different object
```
```python
def remove_dups(L1, L2):    # not good: gives wrong results
    for e in L1:
        if e in L2:
            L1.remove(e)

def remove_dups_new(L1, L2):
    L1_copy = L1[:]         # copy before iterate
    for e in L1_copy:
        if e in L2:
            L1. remove(e)
```
