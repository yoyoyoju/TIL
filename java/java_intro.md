### Java
* Java is platform indepecdent
* how the java works:
    * source code -> [Java Compiler] -> bytecode
    * The bytecode is distributed
    * interpreter depending on the machine translates the bytecode into Machine code
* how to:
    * source code (.java file)
    * compile by `javac java_file.java`
    * -> output (.class file)
    * ran by JVM (java virtual machine) `java java_file.class`
* Object oriented
* multithreaded


* no boolean test on an integer
