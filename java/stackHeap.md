# Stack and Heap
* two areas of memory
    * the heap a.k.a garbage-collectible heap
        * where objects live
    * the stack
        * where method invocations and local variables live
        * methods are stacked
            * when a method is called, the method lands on the top of a call stack
        * local varibales : a.k.a stack variables
            * declared inside a method, including method parameters
            * temporary
            * live only as long as the method is on the stack
