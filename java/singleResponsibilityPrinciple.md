# Single Responsibility Principle
* each class should have only one clear role
* give sensible name, split the source code files into packages according to their functionality, use, etc.

### package
* use packages
* `package packageName;`
* packages can contain other packages
* `package library.domain;`
* import to use classes in the package
* `import library.domain.Book;`
* without visibility modifier (public, private) it is package visible as default
