### Static Class Libraries and Final
* Static: NOT related to objects but to classes.
* class library: a class which contains common-use methods and variables
    * for example - Math class
* final: once we assign a value to a variable, we cannot assign a new one to it.
    * constants are written with CAPITAL_LETTERS_AND_UNDERLINE_CHARACTERS

* non-static: related to objects
